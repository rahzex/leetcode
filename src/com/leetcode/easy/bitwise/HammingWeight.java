     * Explanation for below hammingWeight1():
     * n = 23 = {10111}2 .
     * 1. Initially, count = 0.
     * 2. Now, n will change to n&(n-1). As n-1 = 22 = {10110}2 , then n&(n-1) will be {101112 & {10110}2, which will be {10110}2 which is equal to 22.
     *    Therefore, n will change to 22 and count to 1.
     * 3. As n-1 = 21 = {10101}2 , then n&(n-1) will be {10110}2 & {10101}2, which will be {10100}2 which is equal to 20.
     *    Therefore, n will change to 20 and count to 2.
     * 4. As n-1 = 19 = {10011}2 , then n&(n-1) will be {10100}2 & {10011}2, which will be {10000}2 which is equal to 16.
     *    Therefore, n will change to 16 and count to 3.
     * 5. As n-1 = 15 = {01111}2 , then n&(n-1) will be {10000}2 & {01111}2, which will be {00000}2 which is equal to 0.
     *    Therefore, n will change to 0 and count to 4.
     * 6. As n = 0, the the loop will terminate and gives the result as 4.
     *
     * Complexity: O(K), where K is the number of ones present in the binary form of the given number.
